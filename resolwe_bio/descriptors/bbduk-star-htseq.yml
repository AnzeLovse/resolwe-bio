        For non-stranded, a read is considered overlapping with a feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite strand as the feature. For stranded and single-end reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature. For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and the second read on the opposite strand. For reverse streanded, these rules are reversed.
